Different Machine learning tasks using different algorithms 

PAC - Passive aggressive classifier to detect covid-19 related fake news.
  - Uses a custom hyper-parameter tuning loop instead of grid search. This allowed for plotting accuracy averages for each combination of hyper-parameter to visual show the changes in performance. 

Support Vector Machine - Support vector machine to detect covid-19 related fake news.
  - Uses a custom hyper-parameter tuning loop instead of grid search. This allowed for plotting accuracy averages for each combination of hyper-parameter to visual show the changes in performance.
