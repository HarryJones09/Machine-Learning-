Different Machine learning tasks using different algorithms 

key libaries 

 - Pandas 
 - Sci-kit learn
 - Numpy 
 - Matplotlib 
 - Natural Language ToolKit
 - Tensor flow Keras 

PAC - Passive aggressive classifier to detect covid-19 related fake news.
  - Uses a custom hyper-parameter tuning loop instead of grid search. This allowed for plotting accuracy averages for each combination of hyper-parameter to visual show the changes in performance. 
  - Includes the data pre-processing techniques  including, handling of missing data through deletion, over sampling and under sampling techniques to resolve the class imbalance inssue, data visualizations, removal of outliers, lower case all the documents, removal of all numbers, punctuation and stop words in each document and stemming the words in each document.
  - uses term frequency - inverse document frequency to extract the features
 
 
Support Vector Machine - Support vector machine to detect covid-19 related fake news.
  - Uses a custom hyper-parameter tuning loop instead of grid search. This allowed for plotting accuracy averages for each combination of hyper-parameter to visual show the changes in performance. 
  - Includes the data pre-processing techniques  including, handling of missing data through deletion, over sampling and under sampling techniques to resolve the class imbalance inssue, data visualizations, removal of outliers, lower case all the documents, removal of all numbers, punctuation and stop words in each document and stemming the words in each document.
  - uses term frequency - inverse document frequency to extract the features


Deep Learning - Recurrent Neural Network to detect covid-19 related fake news.
  - Uses a custom hyper-parameter tuning loop instead of grid search. This allowed for plotting accuracy averages for each combination of hyper-parameter to visual show the changes in performance. 
  - Includes the data pre-processing techniques  including, handling of missing data through deletion, over sampling and under sampling techniques to resolve the class imbalance inssue, data visualizations, removal of outliers, lower case all the documents, removal of all numbers, punctuation and stop words in each document and stemming the words in each document.
  - uses word embeddings to extract the features
  - chosen number of epochs was 100 however for improved performance more could be used. However by using more increases the ocmputational cost when the accuracy scores are already high.
